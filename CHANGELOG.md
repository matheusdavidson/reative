## Migration Guide to v1

- Delete `node_modules`
- Remove `@firetask/core` (if exists)
- Replace `firetask` to `reative`
- Make sure all reative packages are in version `^1.0.1`
- Replace `.useLog` to `.silent`
- Replace `@reative/ionic` to `@reative/cache`
- Replace `reactive-record` to `records`
- Replace `ReactiveRecord` to `Records`
- Replace `ReactiveModule` to `RecordsModule`
- Replace `ReactiveIonicModule` to `CacheModule`
- Replace `ReactiveFirebaseModule` to `FirebaseModule`
- Replace `$collection.storage()` to the pure function `storage()` exported by cache package
- Replace `ReactiveState` to `State`
- Replace `ReactiveStateModule` to `StateModule`

```ts
// before
this.storage = this.$collection.storage();
// after
import { storage } from '@reative/cache';
this.storage = storage();
```

### Now data is formatted by default, so you don't need to transform it at all. Disable this behaviour by passing `.raw(true)` within the chain

- Remove `.data(true)`
- Remove any `.transformNetwork` or `.transform` that acts as a shortcut to get pure data eg: `.transform(r=>r.data)`
- replace `.useNetwork` to just `network`
- replace `.useCache` to just `cache`
